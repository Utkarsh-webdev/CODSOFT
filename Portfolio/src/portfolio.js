    "I am currently pursuing my Master of Computer Applications (MCA) while actively building a strong foundation in web development. My goal is to become a proficient full-stack developer by continuously learning and applying real-world skills. To gain hands-on experience, I am currently engaged in internship programs where I contribute to real-time projects and collaborative development. I’m also working independently on several projects such as a personal portfolio website, landing pages, and a to-do application — all aimed at enhancing my design thinking, coding skills, and project workflow.",
